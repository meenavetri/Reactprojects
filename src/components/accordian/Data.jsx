        question:" What causes acne?",
        answer:`Acne can be caused by excess sebum oil and clogged pores. Doctors arenâ€™t 
        sure why some people get acne and others do not,
         but some research suggests that hormone levels may play a role. `

        question:"What are the most important parts of a skincare routine?",
        answer:` Since sun damage increases the risk of skin cancer, as well as skin problems ranging
         from wrinkles to dark spots, wearing sunscreen on a daily basis is essential. Choose a
          broad-spectrum sunscreen with a minimum sun protection factor (SPF) of 15. Beyond that,
           it takes just a few minutes each morning and each evening to do the basics: 
        washing with a gentle cleanser and applying a moisturizer to your face and neck.`

        question:"How can I avoid wrinkles?",
        answer:`Wrinkles are a natural result of aging, but you can delay their
         onset or minimize their appearance. To do so, limit sun exposure, wear sunscreen every 
         day, and use skin products that contain antioxidants and retinoids, which can reduce fine lines 
         and wrinkles.`

        id:4,
        question:"What should I do about dark spots?",
        answer:`UV exposure and hormonal changes are two causes of dark spots. Avoiding
         the sun and wearing sunscreen can prevent new dark spots from forming, while exfoliating 
         regularly or using prescription medications may help treat the existing spots you already have.
          Certain dark spot correctors or moisturizers may also make a difference over time. Remember
           to choose the products that are formulated for your skin type.`
